"""
Parses train and dev sets into a dict where each of 7 keys maps
to a list of values for that key in order.

The keys are: user, countries, days, client, session, format, and time

Explained:
user: a B64 encoded, 8-digit, anonymized, unique identifier for each student (may include / or + characters)
countries: a pipe (|) delimited list of 2-character country codes from which this user has done exercises
days: the number of days since the student started learning this language on Duolingo
client: the student's device platform (one of: android, ios, or web)
session: the session type (one of: lesson, practice, or test; explanation below)
format: the exercise format (one of: reverse_translate, reverse_tap, or listen; see figures above)
time: the amount of time (in seconds) it took for the student to construct and
submit their whole answer (note: for some exercises, this can be null due to data logging issues)

Note: Train (293 unique users) and dev (292) sets have the exact same users except for
'aZwloMi1', who only appears in train
